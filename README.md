## Usage

You can do whatever you want with this project. Notice, that it is only a simulation of drivers.

There is no real driving. I won't store any information about your location or something else!

In addition, you can click on the driver to see his information about him and you can navigate around using the bottom right button.

You can set your pickup and destination location and will draw a route for you.
